		Used to complement the consumer-pull data flow specification convention
		that OWL-S implements with a producer-push oriented convention. This
		property makes forward navigation possible, that is, it allows to navigate
		from some source parameter to its sink parameter(s). Consequently, it
		describes the inverse direction of ValueOf binding descriptions (which
		realize backwards data flow navigation, aka consumer-pull).

		Describes the data flow coming from a parameter (i.e., the source,
		which is	either an Output or Input) of a parent process and going to
		be consumed by an	Input of the enclosed process.
		Input-to-input	connections may seem to be illegal but they are
		required whenever	some sub process receives the value for some of its
		inputs from some input of the top level process (in this case the
		latter is always a composite process).

		In general, a data flow specification connects some source parameter
		to one ore more sink parameter(s). This property is intended to be
		used to track the most specific sink parameter type from the set of
		consumers of some source parameter. Hence, this property is meant to
		be computed by some tool when analyzing the data flow specification
		of some composite process.
